# odin-javascript-knights-travails
Github repository for the Knights Travails project from the Odin Project's JavaScript course.

This project focused on the concept and implementation of graph and graph traversals. 
I chose to use an adjacency list to represent the graph, which was used for a Breadth first search for the shortest path from one square to another. The BFS was implemented using a queue of paths and an array of visited vertices. Once a path was found that ended at the desired end point, it was returned and processed into the displayed outcome text.
